## Data-Professional-Survey-PowerBI

By Samah Mohammed Ahmed

## About the Project

This project explores a global data professionals survey dataset using Microsoft Power BI to uncover insights about the data industry. It analyzes key metrics such as salary levels, job roles, work-life balance satisfaction, and career entry difficulty. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships that reveal trends in how data professionals experience and perceive their careers.

The dashboard was created as part of a data visualization learning journey, demonstrating the end-to-end process of cleaning, transforming, and visualizing real-world survey data using Power Query Editor and Power BI.

## The Key Insights

- Work-Life vs Salary Happiness:
  - Average Work-Life Balance (5.74) is higher than Salary Happiness (4.27). Most data professionals feel underpaid for their effort, even though they enjoy a balanced lifestyle.

- Impact of Salary on Happiness:
  - Higher salaries greatly increase overall satisfaction — many see tough jobs as “worth it” when pay is good, while low pay drives unhappiness.

- Role-Based Satisfaction:
  - Data Scientists (6.12) and Database Developers (5.68) report the highest satisfaction. Students/Job Seekers (4.12 ) are the least happy, mainly due to lower average salaries. Despite data science being hard to enter (1.59%), the high salary makes it rewarding.

- Programming Languages:
  - Python is the clear favorite, followed by R.
  - JavaScript and Java received very few votes.

- Country Observation:
  - Canada had the fewest survey participants (38 of 681) and no Database Developers among respondents.
